# Squawk Log

A utility to combine and enhance CLI and GUI application output.

When creating my first command line applications in Node.JS I found myself in need of a wrapper for console.log. Squawk was born to unify my applications, and to provide a framework to enable rapid creation of simple GUI utilities with very little modication to the CLI application.

## Installation

Installation will be via `npm`

## Usage

`sqwk = require('squawk')`

For documentation Refer to `example.js`
